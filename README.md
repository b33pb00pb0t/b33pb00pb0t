# 👋 Hi there!

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm currently exploring the exciting intersection of **Cybersecurity 🔐** and **Artificial Intelligence 🤖**. My journey is all about understanding how these two fields blend — from using AI to detect threats to securing AI systems themselves.

## 🚀 What I'm Working On
- Building small projects and tools to **experiment with security + AI applications**
- Also, building some passion projects.

## 🧠 What I'm Learning
- Security principles and practices (e.g., OWASP, secure coding)
- Python for cybersecurity scripting and AI workflows
- Machine learning concepts like anomaly detection, adversarial examples, and model interpretability

## 📌 Interests
- Threat intelligence powered by machine learning
- Red teaming AI systems
- Defensive automation using AI tools
- Cryptography
- Privacy, encryption, and digital forensics

## 🌱 Always Open to...
- Collaborations on AI + cybersecurity projects
- Learning from open-source contributors and researchers
- Connecting with others passionate about ethical tech
